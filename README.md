# Machine Learning From Scratch With Numpy
Machine learning algorithms from scratch using numpy 

***

### Features
- Self-contained CSV dataset loader
- Toy dataset generator
    * For linear regression
- Models
    - Linear Regressor (solved by Pseudoinverse, Gradient Descent and SGD)

### Setup
[LINUX] To properly use the package, run the following commands (assuming ```conda``` is installed):

```
conda create -n mlpy "python=3.10"
conda activate mlpy
conda install numpy matplotlib prettytable
python3 setup.py install
```

You may also install it globally outside of a venv (Matplotlib and Numpy must be installed);


### Examples
To run the usage examples, run ```python3 examples/*.py``` with the "*" as the desired example file (Don't forget to activate the mlpy virtual envinronment).
More information about each example file is to be added in a README.md inside the examples folder in the future.

### Contributing
As this is a personal project focused on reviewing and applying concepts that I've studied before,
I don't intend to make it open to contributions just yet. Nevertheless, if you may fork this and use it
for whatever purpose, as well as contacting me using the channels in my main profile readme if you want to 
share any mistakes you may spot in it or provide any feedback or ideas for other project (including collab ones).
